INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING THE MOCK USER ACCOUNT

Since you can't create users directly with SQL in Supabase, you need to create the user account through the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Log in to your Supabase Dashboard
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com/
   - Log in with your credentials
   - Select your project

2. Create the user account
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Authentication" → "Users"
   - Click "New user"
   - Enter the following details:
     - Email: test@agency.com
     - Password: password123
     - User metadata (optional):
       - name: Test User
       - phone: 9876543210

3. Confirm the user email
   - After creating the user, you may need to confirm the email address
   - Look for a "Confirm" button next to the user in the user list
   - Click it to confirm the email address

4. Verify the data
   - Run the check-mock-data.sql script in your Supabase SQL editor
   - This will show you if the mock data was inserted correctly

5. Test the login
   - Start your web application:
     cd apps/web
     pnpm dev
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
   - Log in with:
     - Email: test@agency.com
     - Password: password123

If you're still having issues after following these steps, please check:

1. That all the SQL commands in insert-mock-data.sql ran successfully
2. That the user account was created and confirmed in the Supabase Dashboard
3. That your environment variables in apps/web/.env.local are correct:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL should match your Supabase project URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY should match your Supabase anon key
